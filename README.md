illuminatocomments
==================

# Introduction

This project is a rewrite of the mymodcomments Prestashop module https://github.com/FabienSerny/mymodcomments developped in the Fabien Serny's Book "Prestashop Module Development" http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24175073-prestashop-module-development using [Illuminato](https://github.com/dedesite/illuminato) module.

His goal is to show the simplicity (and superiority!) of [Illuminato](https://github.com/dedesite/illuminato) approach which is based on Laravel Framework.

# Pre requis

You need to have Prestashop 1.6 and [Illuminato](https://github.com/dedesite/illuminato) module installed.

# Status

This module does not currently implement all the mymodcomments features (ie hook, front & admin controllers), cause my goal is to rewrite completely those features with October CMS philosophy.
